## Overview

This repository provides:
- a light version of the experimental image dataset,
- the Python code used for model training and evaluation,
- the performance metrics obtained from cross-validation experiments.

The materials are released to support transparency, reproducibility and methodological reuse.

## 1. DatasetLight.zip

### Description

`DatasetLight.zip` represents a *light version* of the full experimental dataset used in the associated study. It contains a representative subset of the original images and is provided to support transparency, reproducibility, and methodological understanding, while limiting data volume.

The light dataset includes RGB images of four plant species acquired under controlled conditions and different light treatments. The images were selected to preserve the diversity of species, growth stages, and illumination conditions present in the full dataset.

### Directory structure

The dataset is organized according to the following hierarchical structure:
